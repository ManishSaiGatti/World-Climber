# World Climber
This is an endless runner game based on the game Ice Climber. The player controls the character to move upwards to each platform. Player has the choice of moving through the holes present in each platform level or breaking their own hole to jump through. There is a timer that starts at 60 seconds and counts down, and when it reaches zero, the player loses. The player can collect stars they find along the way to increase their time. There are also 4 different enemy types that spawn as the player gets higher. Going higher means a higher score. A special game framework, the minimalist game framework, was used to make this game.
The main language used to make the game is C#.
